Co-founder at CoPlane, where we're using AI to solve complex problems in the enterprise back-office and thereby global B2B trade.

I've been fortunate to work at the intersection of technology and business:

- Was lead product architect at Segment, where I helped define the CDP category and led the platform and foundation groups.
- Executing strategic acquisitions and investments at Stripe in partnership with business leaders and product teams.

My approach combines full stack chops, technical rigor and intuition, and a capital allocator's perspective â€” finding patterns across domains and translating them into practical solutions. I believe the best products emerge from a deep understanding at the intersection of human and organizational needs, system design, and *what the technology wants*.

Currently interested in how AI is reshaping markets, the evolution of developer tools that augment human creativity, and the future of enterprise software in a world of AI agents.
